<p>Course Description Here. This is an example one from CS 304: A study 
  of the three-layer architecture commonly used for Web-based applications 
  such as e-commerce sites. We will learn to model and design databases using
   entity-relationship diagrams and the Standard Query Language (SQL) for managing
    databases. We will focus on Flask, a popular Python-based web micro-framework, 
    as well as important alternatives such as Node.js. We will learn about implementing 
    features using Ajax. We will also discuss performance, reliability, and security 
    issues. Finally, we will create dynamic websites driven by database entries.</p>
